Positive
- Video makes it look like a very artsy page
	-*constructive - make it scale with when you change the screens size
	-can be confusing when you make the screen different and youre looking at a different part of the video
-Social media buttons look good and solid placement
	-*Make a hover affect when you go over it maybe to make it pop

Constructive
- You should make drop downs for some of the navbar items
- Also, when the screen get's smaller could maybe help to have a hamburger icon with everything consolidated inside
-Put your picture somewhere maybe?
